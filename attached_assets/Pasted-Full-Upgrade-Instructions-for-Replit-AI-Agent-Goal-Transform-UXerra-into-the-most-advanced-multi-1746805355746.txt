Add missing icon to Real-Time Animation card (e.g., motion, bolt, or loop icon from Lucide).

Use TailwindCSS for all styling and responsive layouts.

Store generated content and user data securely

🎨 Visual Upgrades:

🆘 Fallback ZIP Build (if AI fails):

✅ All features above (HTML + TailwindCSS + JS)

✅ Working frontend demo

✅ Responsive pages with animations

✅ Basic i18n & API placeholders

✅ Structured folders for easy Vercel deploy

📌 Final Note:
This must be a fully functional, secured, and professionally designed SaaS platform — better than Webflow, Figma, Canva, Framer.
💥 It must load fast, look futuristic, and be prepared for global scale.
