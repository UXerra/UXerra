UXerra ‚Äì Visual & UI/UX Overhaul Inspired by LanderX & Fluence

Please transform the UXerra platform to match or exceed the visual quality, flow, and interactive design of the following reference sites:

LanderX (Framer)

Fluence (Framer)

üé® Design Goals & Improvements:
1. Visual & Layout Enhancements
Use fluid grid layout with full-width content blocks, scroll-triggered transitions, and animated sections.

Replace current static design with:

Dynamic 3D illustrations

Animated floating icons, interactive particles

Parallax effects on scroll (GSAP or Framer Motion)

Replace image placeholders with real visuals (see demo examples).

Make sections overlap softly, like Fluence (floating elements, blur, gradients).

Add gradient masks, hover animations, and clean shadows.

2. Add Visual Sections like:
‚ÄúTrusted by‚Äù logos (add dummy icons or real client-style logos)

Use-case mockups (how a generated site or logo would look)

Testimonial carousel with user photos + reviews

Featured templates preview (free vs premium)

Comparison table: Free vs Pro features

üß∞ New Sections to Include (Fully Visual & Functional)
Gallery Section: Browse and preview templates, logos, designs (with filters)
