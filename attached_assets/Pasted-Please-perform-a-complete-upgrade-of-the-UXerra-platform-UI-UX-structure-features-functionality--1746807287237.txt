Please perform a complete upgrade of the UXerra platform UI, UX, structure, features, functionality, visuals, and pricing logic.

🧭 Smart Navigation Menu (New)
Implement a smart dropdown menu with 3–4 main categories only.

Example from Zipchat: visual category menu with icons and subcategories.

Suggested structure:

Create (AI Tools: Image, Video, Logo, Templates, Presentations...)

Explore (Templates Gallery, Icon Library, Free vs Paid)

Hire Expert (Custom Design Orders, Submit Brief)

Resources or Community (Blog, Tutorials, Case Studies, Help)

🔁 Current “Features” menu is broken – clicking does nothing. Fix and expand into proper UX mega menu.

🧩 Missing & Incomplete Features (Add or Fix)
Add “AI Branding Wizard” as seen in UI.

Content Generator must allow:

“Paste a URL” → auto-fetch + summarize content.

Generate entire multipage layout from prompt or link.

Add missing services:

Social Media Post Generator

Cover Image Generator

Brand Kit Export (.zip)

PDF Presentation Generator

Wireframe to Website converter (upload sketch/image)

💻 Full Visual/UX Enhancement
Replace current homepage graphics with:

Animated UX Cube or UX/X visuals (examples provided).

Three.js or GSAP-based animated background, real-time transitions.

Real-Time Animation card still missing an icon – use lucide:zap or motion.

Apply correct branding to logo:

“UX” in blue, “erra” in white on dark / black on light.

Use Framer Motion + TailwindCSS for all micro-interactions.

🌍 Multilingual Upgrade
Keep EN, SLO, DE, ES – add:

FR, IT, PT, PL, TR, RU, ZH, JA, AR

Use i18n + auto language detection with fallback

Translate all pages + dynamically serve localized content

🔐 Security & Data Protection
Sanitize all user input

Encrypt all API keys and data

Store generated content securely

Enable HTTPS and GDPR compatibility

🛒 Pricing Page (New)
Add full pricing section for Custom Brand Website Orders (like on image example):

Plan 1: Classic (1 request at a time, no Framer)

Plan 2: Pro (2 active tasks, Framer site, custom animations)

Add toggle for monthly/yearly pricing

Add “Start Brief” button that links to order form

📦 Final Requirement
If AI encounters issues, create a fully functional fallback ZIP project with:

All code, design, AI tools, working generators, pricing, gallery, form logic

Tailwind + Next.js compatible

Ready for Vercel deployment

Include sample images, UX cube or branding visuals, icons, translated JSONs

✅ Every element must be:
Intelligent

Visually stunning

Multilingual

Mobile-optimized

Secure and API-ready

Better than platforms like Webflow, Figma, Canva, Framer
